Does anyone else out there feel that because you devote a disgusting amount of hours to something sooooooo specific that you are pushing out the more general knowledge in your brain? You know, something like a dissertation, project, watching The Office on Netflix 143 times... *Seriously, I challenge anyone to trivia on The Office*. I just need a break sometimes to learn something new.

Google released a pretty swell tool this week, which essentially indexes publicly available datasets and makes them searchable much in the same way you would "google" anything. My one qualm with the whole thing is actually the name, [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch); it's just...meh. 

 Broadly speaking, I am interested in languages. Today, much of my work lands in the realm of computational linguistics and in a past life of mine I was mapping language family phylogenies to geographic distributions of languages. "Languages" just seemed like a good place to start my Google Dataset Search. I quickly stumbled up a Kaggle dataset titled "[World Atlas of Language Structures](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch/search?query=languages&docid=6GpBhAxWvCVR6Ny%2BAAAAAA%3D%3D)". First impressions? Wonderful distraction and what a great way to learn Altair. 
 
 [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a `python` graphics package for "declarative visualizations". I gotta be honest, plotting with `python` has always been underwhelming, particularly when compared to the other tools out there (`ggplot2` in `R` or `D3` for `javascript`). HOWEVER, I've been seeing a lot surrounding `Altair` that I've been liking and I've been meaning to give `python` plotting a thir...tieth chance. What better way
