I'm James, an Anthropology PhD Candidate at Mizzou who dabbles in the dark arts of neural networks. My research involves understanding the city and the people who live within it. In a way, indivdidual actors living in a city are cooperating and competing like the cells of an organism. Why are people afraid of immigrants? Does neighborhood demographic composition make a difference? These of the types of questions I'm asking and seeking the answers to. 

If you're curious, I develop in `Python` and `R` and have a decent background in `SQL`. I also speak English, French and have created an English pidgin langauge that I use to speak *to* and *for* my dogs. I'm also fortunate enough to have married the most brilliant woman in the world! Her name is Jennifer and she is hella cool!

Oh, *The Office* is my favorite TV show, anything *X-Files* is the way to my heart and I love music (\*clich√©\*). Thanks for stopping by!
