I'm James, a computational social scientist who researches diversity in sociotechnical systems. I'm primarily interested in two separate, yet complimentary, research questions: 1) *What can technology and data tell us about demographic diversity?* and 2) *How are minority and vulnerable populations affected by technology?* These questions are informed by my broad interests in measurements of diversity, intergroup relations, computational linguistics and data science.
