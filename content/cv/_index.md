## Software

[`LOVELACE`](github.com/jcbain/lovelace)
Lovelace is a convolutional neural network designed to learn the semantics of short, unstructured text, such as Tweets. Models can be trained to classify the sentiment, author or category of text given the appropriately labelled training data.

<sub><sup>`python`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`tensorflow`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`pandas`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`numpy`</sup></sub>

&nbsp;

[`HATERZMAPPER`](github.com/jcbain/haterzmapper)
HaterzMapper extends subsetting functionality of geometric simple features for simpler geographic analysis. This includes integrating with US Census API wrapper, tidycensus, to provide further data collecting capabilities.

<sub><sup>`R`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`tidycensus`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`sf`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`dplyr`</sup></sub>

&nbsp;

[`CUTTLEFISH`](github.com/jcbain/cuttlefish)
Cuttlefish is a color palette creator in which palettes can be created by supplying an image. Colors are selected by evenly spacing out colors on the color hue wheel.

&nbsp;

[`HDI FORECASTER`](hdiforecaster.shinyapps.io/global_dev/)
A Shiny application designed to visualize the Human Development Index, and indicator of human development within a nation, and its regional forecast trajectory into 2030. This forecast modelled off of the ARIMA algorithm.
