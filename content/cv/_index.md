## Software

[`LOVELACE`](github.com/jcbain/lovelace)
Lovelace is a convolutional neural network designed to learn the semantics of short, unstructured text, such as Tweets. Models can be trained to classify the sentiment, author or category of text given the appropriately labelled training data.

&nbsp;

[`HATERZMAPPER`](github.com/jcbain/haterzmapper)
HaterzMapper extends subsetting functionality of geometric simple features for simpler geographic analysis. This includes integrating with US Census API wrapper, tidycensus, to provide further data collecting capabilities.
