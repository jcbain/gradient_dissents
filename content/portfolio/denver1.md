Sunday nights are for laundry, mental preparation for the week ahead and House Hunters. It's a bit of a mental reprieve for me; for a few minutes out of the week I can forget about my life and focus on the lives of complete strangers who are making one of the biggest financial decisions they'll ever step into. Sure, I know they choose their house before filming (logistically, that's the only way this show could work) but I still find it refreshing to watch seemingly boring people discuss what sort of floor plan will work for their dinner parties they hope to have. People also like to make their home lives convenient for their work lives and the most apparent indication of this the trade-off discussions between a dream home and proximity to work. Sometimes this results in smaller square footage in order to be within throwing distance of the office. Other times its the manicured McMansion in exchange for a part time job driving to work every week. 

Whether we realize it or not, transportation plays a key role in our lives and transportation is made possible by the appropriate infrastructure. Tramlines, bike paths, highways, they can all bring about opportunity for communities. But opportunity for whom and what expense? This post is the first in a series of posts that will explore how transportation shapes the lives of communities.
