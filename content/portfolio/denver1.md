Sunday nights are for laundry, mental preparation for the week ahead and House Hunters. It's a bit of a mental reprieve for me; for a few minutes out of the week I can forget about my life and focus on the lives of complete strangers who are making one of the biggest financial decisions they'll ever step into. Sure, I know they choose their house before filming (logistically, that's the only way this show could work) but I still find it refreshing to watch seemingly boring people discuss what sort of floor plan will work for their dinner parties they hope to have. People also like to make their home lives convenient for their work lives and the most apparent indication of this the trade-off discussions between a dream home and proximity to work. Sometimes this results in smaller square footage in order to be within throwing distance of the office. Other times its the manicured McMansion in exchange for a part time job driving to work every week. 

Whether we realize it or not, transportation plays a key role in our lives and transportation is made possible by the appropriate infrastructure. Tramlines, bike paths, highways, they can all bring about opportunity for communities. But opportunity for whom and what expense? This post is the first in a series of posts that will explore how transportation shapes the lives of communities. 

The story begins in Denver, Colorado. More specifically, the highway system in Denver and how it creates borders between opportunity. Borders are often arbitrary and invisible (think countries). These types of borders create their own types of problems but this isn't that sort of story. Instead, the highways of Denver (and many [other cities in the US](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/role-of-highways-in-american-poverty/474282/)) establish physical borders that separate communities. But before we get into any of that, let's first set the scene. 

For those of you unfamiliar with Denver, the population in 2010 was a bit north of 600,000. Since then, the population has grown nearly 17% in the past 7 years making it one of the fastest growing cities in all of the United States. The city supports a metropolitan population of 2.9 million people all of who enjoy an average of 300 days of sunshine a year. Throw in the Rockies as your backdrop and Denver is one the most appealing cities for people who straddle the fence between outdoors enthusiasts and city-slickin'. 

Denver also resides at the confluence of I-70, the major East-West artery of the continental United states, and I-25, which runs North-South. Highways are noisy, dangerous and dirty, but they are also a necessity for many people's lives. Getting to and from work, family and fun would be hardly worth it without the ease of cruising 70+ miles down the interstate. This, like many things in life, poses a classic trade-off scenario. On one hand, residing next to the highway means listening to semis fly by your house every second of every day; on the other, getting to where you need to go is faster, which translates to more time with the family (whomever that may be üê∂). So the first question that I wanted to look at was "Is living by the highway more or less desirable?" To answer this question, I made my way to [Denver's Open Data portal](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata). Desirability is a complex indicator to measure but what is reasonable is to assess the neighborhood economic situations of a city. I'm going to make a gross generalization/assumption here, but living in poorer conditions is less desirable than living in more economically fortunate ones. I found a [data-set of the Housing and Urban Development's assessment of poverty in middle income for each Census tract for 2014 in the city of Denver](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-hud-income-levels). This provided me with a decent set economic data to answer this question. I also needed highway data in order to evaluate the geographic component of this question. 

I thought to first look at Census tracts that touch highways and then those tracts that touch tracts that touch highways in case there was any gradient like behavior in poverty levels as people got further away from highways.

This direction ended in some simple exploration. There was no reason to believe that the distribution of low-income individual proportions were any different for those who live in areas touching highways as opposed to those living a bit farther out.

<sub>*Fig 1*: The distribution of poverty isn't much different between those blocks that touch highways and those that don't. In these particular data, the mean poverty proportion is higher for those that touch the highway but not enough to warrant difference.</sub>
