Hi! I'm an Anthropology PhD candidate who studies demographic diversity and immigration using a variety of computational techniques broadly framed as "data science". 

![This is me][1]

Conceptually, I'm interested in understanding how diversity and geography interact with perceptions surrounding minority and vulnerable populations, particularly migrants and low-income individuals. This has led me down a path of computation and data science where I've integrated different data sources including social media, Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics data. 

I also like to ask and analyze questions surrounding the geography of opportunity. *What factors allow for the poor to move out of poverty?* and *what policies are designed to keep populations separated?*, these are just few...


### Software
I have experience building software designed for and/or directly using machine learning. These libraries serve as tools to help me answer the social scientific and geography questions I'm interested in.

[`LOVELACE`](github.com/jcbain/lovelace)
Lovelace is a convolutional neural network designed to learn the semantics of short, unstructured text, such as Tweets. Models can be trained to classify the sentiment, author or category of text given the appropriately labelled training data.
<sub><sup>`python`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`tensorflow`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`pandas`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`numpy`</sup></sub>

[`HATERZMAPPER`](github.com/jcbain/haterzmapper)
HaterzMapper extends subsetting functionality of geometric simple features for simpler geographic analysis. This includes integrating with US Census API wrapper, tidycensus, to provide further data collecting capabilities.
<sub><sup>`R`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`tidycensus`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`sf`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`dplyr`</sup></sub>

[`CUTTLEFISH`](github.com/jcbain/cuttlefish)
Cuttlefish is a color palette creator in which palettes can be created by supplying an image. Colors are selected by evenly spacing out colors on the color hue wheel.
<sub><sup>`R`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`colorspace`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`magick`</sup></sub> 

[`HDI FORECASTER`](hdiforecaster.shinyapps.io/global_dev/)
A Shiny application designed to visualize the Human Development Index, and indicator of human development within a nation, and its regional forecast trajectory into 2030. This forecast modelled off of the ARIMA algorithm.
<sub><sup>`R`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`shiny`</sup></sub> <sub><sup>`ggplot2`</sup></sub> 

### A bit more...
Above is the professional me + some of the things I find fun...like programming and gis tools. But a bit more about me... you know... the real me.

My wife is the most intelligent and loveliest person üòç.

I love dogs. I have two, Pippa and Prairie üêï.

Coffee is my favorite beverage. My consumption could be problematic ‚òïÔ∏è.

I also like music üé∂, cooking ü•ò,dinosaurs ü¶ï and cephalopods ü¶ë.

Oh I also love The X-Files üëΩ!
